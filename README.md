Introduction 
Heart attacks are a leading killer globally. A high number of individuals unknowingly face the danger until it becomes too late. Early detection of risk can allow people to get assisted or make positive changes to prevent the occurrence of severe issues. Here we employ machine learning to identify the potential of a heart attack. We analyze data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other health indicators. The information is sourced from a Kaggle dataset that is a collection of many patients' records. We intend to come up with a model that would aid the doctors and people to be aware of the risk and to lead a healthy life.
